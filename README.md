network project

In this project we have implemented a software program like wireshark Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions.
We have used python programming language, by the help of scapy library which provides powerful functions for packet capturing.

Our software captures packets and monitor a view of the packets’ details,                     the main table views source IP , destination IP , time of packet arrival, packet number, packet length and protocol.
User controls when to start capturing and when to stop by pressing the start or stop button. When user selects a specific packet more details and information appear, on the left side of the table, like checksum , flags, version ….etc
Also a hexa view of the packets is provided for the selected packet. 
User can also save the captured packets when pressing quit a window appears to ask the user if he/she wants to save the captured packets.
note: complete code is found in final file
